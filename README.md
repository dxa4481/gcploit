# gcploit

This repo has the code for the gcploit exploit framework, the BFS search tool meant for defensive threat models, a mock org simulator, as well as stack driver queries that profile the gcploit tool.

If you haven't seen our talk yet, it's available here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml09R38jpok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml09R38jpok)

### BFS Search

To start you'll need the `cloudasset.assets.analyzeIamPolicy` permission at the organization level to use this tool.

Next do a `gcloud auth login` an complete the flow.

Finally run the tool `python bfs.py --org_id <orgId> --source <serviceAccountEmail>`

This will print the results of the BFS from your starting service account inside your org

Note bindings that come from other orgs won't be included here

### Mock Graph

To generate a mock graph, from the dummyOrg directory, run `python mockgraph.py` and copy `nodes.json` `edges.json` and `innocent_edges.json` into `animated-bfs` and then serve the content in the `animated-bfs` directory with `python -m http.server`

### Gcploit

Gcploit is a proof of concept, as-is framework for exploiting GCP. It includes some (not all) of the exploits we talked about in our talk.

These include:

    actAs
    dataproc
    actAs with VM's instead of GCF

As of this moment, we don't have the following exploits implmented yet:
    
    tokenCreator
    dataflow
    composer
    compute admin
    dataprep
    google managed service account privesc (ie cloudbuild)
    datafusion
    cloudbuild

To use the tool, docker is required.

First create an alias for the tool:

To mount in a base identity, authenticate to the base identity, and then pass in your gcloud credentials to the tool. Your credentials are typically found in $HOME/.config, so below is an example alias

    alias gcploit="docker run -v $(pwd)/db:/db -v $HOME/.config:/root/.config -it --rm dxa4481/gcploit python main.py"

Now you should be able to run:

    gcploit --list

If everything goes well you'll see no output

now you can try an exploit out:

    gcploit --exploit actas --project <project_name> --target_sa all

This exploit requires the base identity have `actAs` and `functionCreator` on the target project. In the future support for this without the `functionCreator` permission may be added (ie `computeAdmin` instead to use VM's instead of Functions)


Now if you run `gcloud --list` if all went well you should see a bunch of new service accounts you took control of through actAs

To interact with one of these try:

    gcploit --gcloud "projects list" --source <8charname>

now you can add the --source flag to your exploits and try something like

    gcploit --exploit actas --project <new_project_name> --source <8charname> --target_sa all

#### The use of a Proxy

Note often times oauth creds are all we get from these exploits, not json creds. To use these we spin up a proxy service in the function and live replace the oauth creds on outbound requests. This was done in a hacky way, and as a result it involves setting a proxy variable and unsetting a proxy variable in your .config. If the tool errors out or is killed mid command it's possible these may persist, and to clean it up you can run:

    gcloud config unset proxy/port
    gcloud config unset proxy/type
    gcloud config unset proxy/address
    gcloud config unset core/custom_ca_certs_file

#### Stack Driver Queries

The following Stack Driver query should give you insight into if this tool is being used against you in your environment:

```text    
protoPayload.request.function.timeout="539s"
```

The following examples demonstrate how to query logs using the gcloud CLI tool. 
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/logging/read

Query logs across an organization:
```bash 
gcloud logging read $STACK_DRIVER_FILTER --organization=$ORGANIZATION_ID --format json
```

Query logs in a specific folder: 
```bash 
gcloud logging read $STACK_DRIVER_FILTER --folder=$FOLDER_ID --format json
```

Query logs in a specific project:
```bash 
gcloud logging read $STACK_DRIVER_FILTER --project=$PROJECT_ID --format json
```
